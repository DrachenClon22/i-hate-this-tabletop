# i-hate-this-tabletop
 
Version: 1.0.0-alpha<br>
This abandoned project was supposed to be some sort of a table for dnd like games with friends online

Features:
1. Connect/host/disconnect (wow) to people using their ip, it is recommended to use hamachi like software
2. Save and load the map
3. Won't be mentioning things like character(or camera) controls etc, its obvious

So far there has been one successful game of checkers with my friends(!) So it's not that bad
